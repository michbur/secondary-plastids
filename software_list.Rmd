# Secondary plastids

Software for prediction of proteins targeted to secondary plastids (mostly based on the ASAFAP motif):

 - HECTAR (2008) (https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-393) - only heterokonts,
 - ASAFind (2015) (https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.12734) - all types of secondary plastids.

## Apicoplast

Software for prediction of only apicoplast-targeted and related proteins:

 - ApicoAMP (2013) (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2013.09.017) - apicoplast-targeted transmembrane proteins.
 - ApicoAP (2012) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0036598) - apicoplast-targeted proteins.
 - PlasmoAP (2003) (https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1078599) - apicoplast-targeted proteins.
 - PATS (2001) (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-1119(01)00776-4) - apicoplast-targeted proteins.

# Chromatophores

*Paulinella chromatophora* obtained 90–140 Ma ago photosynthetic organelles named chromatophores - very early stage of host-organellum integration.
